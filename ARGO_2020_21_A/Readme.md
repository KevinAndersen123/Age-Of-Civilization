Online Gaming
----------------------------
The features marked with (OG) are for online gaming and the use of the mirror is primarily used multiplayer which is on main
branch and attempt on the gameplay is within the feature branch for OG. The multiplayer only works on local host.

Games Engineering 2
-------------------------------
The features marked with GE2 are the ones that have been implemented using interop. On the main branch the interop is used for the 
fuzzy logic calls which are returned to the ai. I have attached the cpp zip for it within the project. I have also attached the project
which bases have been used for an attempt of Astar interop but it failed, to code in that file is the one that would have been used.

AI For Games
-------------------------------
The features marked with AI are the ones that utilize the ai logic. Astar path finding can be found with the file MapGrid and
FuzzyLogic can be found within the AI behavior. The interaction with cities for AI behavior is limited due to the issues with the
design of the city.

RWM
-------------------------------
All remaining features within the document are for RWM, the best task and features are listed within the Retrospective document
shared within the drive.
